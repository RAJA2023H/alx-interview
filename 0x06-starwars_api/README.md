Star Wars:
This script prints all characters of a Star Wars movie using the Star Wars API.
The script takes a Movie ID as a positional argument (for example, 3 corresponds to "Return of the Jedi") and displays one character name per line in the same order as the "characters" list in the /films/ endpoint of the Star Wars API.
